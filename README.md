# socket.io

- we created a simple chat application using socket io ,so we can have  connection between the server and clients .

- we used socket.io and socket.io-client packages , and we used a snowpack package for the client .also we used the cors to make the connection between differents ports .

- we can run the application by simply run the server ,then run the client
